#Run This Application
Simply open the index.html file located in the root diectory
and allow the tests to run. The test will show success or failure
based on the results. All Test should result in success.

##Restore To Default
Every Test Affects the Page, but after it validates it will return the page to
its default state. So it might seem like the tests did not run, when indeed they have.
